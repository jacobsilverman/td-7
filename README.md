Team Treehouse Techdegree Project 7

I went for exceeds grade by:

- Changing all fonts to Arial
- Adding box shadow and border radius to the thumbnail class
- Added css animation zoom on hover to thumbnail class

I moved the /images directory to the /public directory.

I created a data folder and have all my user defined text in there. I thought this is more efficient than putting it in
the pug files. The user can change everything they need to change in the json and it propagates through the pug files
by string interpolation. I left the data.json file in the root directory since that was int he project requirements.
